Designed and developed a comprehensive Dairy Sales Dashboard using Power BI to track daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance.
Analyzed sales data for various dairy products (milk, curd, butter, paneer) to identify top-selling items and low-performing SKUs.
Built interactive visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, maps) to present product-wise and region-wise sales trends.
